## Why Markdown

As of today the Markdown language is the defacto standard for documentation in the context of software development. It is just as suitable for writing simple "readme" files as for writing multi-part project documents or even whole books with hundreds of pages.

Key Advantages

* Minimal requirements to the editor.
* Human readable on its own.
* Easily versionable (using version control systems like Git).
* Very popular (wide range of tools and integrations).
* Self-contained and portable.
