## Stories

> I want to contribute documentation to software projects. Therefore, I have to deal a lot with raw material like shell commands and source code abstracts. Also there is a lot of interdependency between various components. Usually this requires to link to related documents together, refer to external stuff like web pages or embedding other to embed resources like images.

> I am only one of many contributors to the project. As the project evolves I need to communicate and coordinate my work with others to make sure the project will be consistent to its goals. When I review shared content I often ask myself which was introduced by whom, when and why.

> The content I create is interesting for a broad and diverse audience. Usually people have also different kind of techniques to consume content. Some prefer reading documents on their desktop computers, mobile phones or ebook readers. They download the content from the web and share the links with each other. They also pass around downloaded content itself via Email or file shares (think of Dropbox) around.

> I work in various teams with different backgrounds, capabilities and resources. At one day I find myself in an environment where I have very powerful custom infrastructure at my finger tips and the other day all I have is a dumb FTP store for a web space.

> To illustrate real things I include different types of content sources in the documents I write. It is important that I can keep my written content in sync with the content I reference and include. The referenced / included content may change frequently, so it should be easy to keep the references / includes up to date. Sometimes I work in distributed teams where it is not unusual to rely on highly distributed cloud infrastructure. Maybe the developers push source code to GitHub repositories while the UI designers push wireframes and PSDs to Dropbox shares.
